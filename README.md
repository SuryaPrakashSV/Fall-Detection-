Video Fall Detection
This project uses OpenCV to detect a person falling in videos with the help of a Haar Cascade classifier. The system processes video frames and analyzes contours to determine if a fall has occurred.

Prerequisites
Make sure to have the following packages installed:

python==2.7.7
numpy==1.14.5
opencv-python==3.4.1.15
pylint==1.9.2
scikit-learn==0.19.1
How It Works
The fall detection algorithm works through the following steps:

1. Frame Processing:
Each frame of the video is captured and converted into grayscale for easier processing.
Grayscale conversion helps reduce the complexity of the image data and is often enough for contour detection.
2. Background Removal:
The background is removed to highlight the moving person. This is done using background subtraction techniques (such as using a background subtractor in OpenCV).
This step helps focus on the moving object (the person) rather than the static background.
3. Contour Detection:
After background removal, contours are detected using edge-detection algorithms (like Canny edge detection) to outline the shapes of moving objects in the frame.
Contours are continuous boundaries or curves that represent the edges of objects. By detecting these, we can focus on the person or object in the frame.
4. Contour Analysis:
The algorithm analyzes the height and width of the detected contours. This step is important because we expect the shape of a person to change when they fall.
If the height of a contour is significantly smaller than its width, it may indicate that the person has fallen (since a standing person would typically have more height than width).
This step is a heuristic that checks for objects with an aspect ratio suggesting a fall.
5. Fall Detection:
If the contourâ€™s height is lower than its width (and passes the threshold criteria), the algorithm increments a fall counter.
If the counter reaches a threshold (e.g., 10 frames), it suggests that the person has been in a "fallen" position for a prolonged period.
Once the threshold is exceeded, a bounding rectangle is drawn around the detected person to visually indicate that a fall has occurred.
6. Visual Feedback:
After detecting a possible fall, the program will highlight the area of the person who is possibly fallen by drawing a rectangle around them.
This allows users to visually verify that the fall detection mechanism is working correctly.
